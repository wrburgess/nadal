# Security Rules

**Applies to:** Code handling secrets, auth, or input
**Deep doc:** `docs/rules/security-postmortems.md` (Tier 2 — deferred; read on demand when a trigger fires)

> Tier-1 Lean Core ([ADR 0004](../docs/adr/0004-two-tier-rules-layer-progressive-context.md)): always-resident invariants. Keep this file lean — push heavy, subsystem-specific case studies down to the deep doc. These are business-neutral, stack-neutral starters; **extend per host** — concrete stack-named examples live in the matching **Stack Overlay** (e.g. `ace-rails`), vendored alongside the baseline.

## Patterns

- **Keep secrets out of the repo.** Use per-environment encrypted credentials or the deploy platform's secret store; read config from there, never from committed literals.
- **Run the scanners before every commit/push.** Wire the host's static-analysis and dependency-audit tools into the required workflow so a vulnerability is caught locally, not in review.
- **Fail closed on authorization.** Deny by default; an action that forgets to authorize should be inaccessible, not open.
- **Normalize input at the boundary** before any authorization or "require a filter" guard.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never commit secrets, API keys, or tokens** — because history is forever and public mirrors get scraped; if one lands, rotate it immediately and scrub the history. *(Extend per host.)*
- **Never blanket-disable a scanner warning without a documented justification** — because an unexplained suppression hides real regressions; annotate it with a reason, who approved it, and the date. *(Extend per host.)*
- **Never trust a bare presence/truthiness check to mean "has a real value"** — because a whitespace-only string (`"   "`) or a collection of only blanks (`["", nil]`) still reads as present; strip/coerce input at the boundary before guarding on it. *(Extend per host.)*
