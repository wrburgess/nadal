# Backend Rules

**Applies to:** Backend / domain code — models, controllers, background jobs, and service objects
**Deep doc:** `docs/rules/backend-postmortems.md` (Tier 2 — deferred; read on demand when a trigger fires)

> Tier-1 Lean Core ([ADR 0004](../docs/adr/0004-two-tier-rules-layer-progressive-context.md)): always-resident invariants. Keep this file lean — push heavy, subsystem-specific case studies down to the deep doc. These are business-neutral, stack-neutral starters; **extend per host** — concrete stack-named examples live in the matching **Stack Overlay** (e.g. `ace-rails`), vendored alongside the baseline.

## Patterns

- **Framework & standard-library first.** Before building anything custom, prefer your framework's built-ins and the standard library, then established, well-maintained libraries. Reach for custom code only when nothing fits — and say why in the assessment/plan.
- **Thin controllers.** Keep controller actions to request/response orchestration; put domain logic in domain models, shared modules, or dedicated service/domain objects.
- **Authorize every non-public action** with the host's authorization layer — deny by default, never hardcode role checks inline.
- **Enforce invariants in the database too.** Pair model validations with DB-level constraints (`NOT NULL`, unique indexes, foreign keys); a validation is not a guarantee under concurrency.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never introduce an implicit global query scope** that silently applies to every read, association, and new-record default — because it silently leaks into every query and is painful to bypass; use explicit, named scopes instead. *(Extend per host.)*
- **Never load a whole table into memory at once** — because iterating every row at once exhausts memory; stream large result sets in batches instead. *(Extend per host.)*
- **Never issue a query per loop iteration (an N+1)** — because it fires a query every time around the loop; preload the data or keep a maintained count instead. *(Extend per host.)*
- **Never add a heavyweight service-object framework** where a plain object would do, without a documented justification — because a plain domain object covers almost every case. *(Extend per host.)*
