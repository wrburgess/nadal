# enforce-branch-creation.sh — PreToolUse guard (Layer 3 fast-fail accelerator, ADR 0009)
#
# Purpose: stop changes from landing on a PROTECTED branch (main/master/develop
# by default) — above all, commits/pushes straight to a protected branch. On
# every other branch an agent is free to write, commit, and push at any time;
# this guard must never get in the way there.
#
# Wired in .claude/settings.json as a PreToolUse hook matching
# "Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Bash". The full tool payload arrives as
# JSON on stdin; we read it rather than trusting $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR.
#
# Why not $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR: a resumed session can re-root that variable onto
# the MAIN checkout even while the session is operating inside a worktree on a
# feature branch. The old hook did `cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR" && git rev-parse`,
# so it read main's HEAD and falsely blocked legitimate feature-branch work.
# We instead evaluate the branch of the ACTUAL target — the file being written,
# or the repo the git command runs in — which is always worktree-correct.
#
# Exit codes (PreToolUse contract):
#   0  → allow the tool call
#   2  → block the tool call; stderr is shown to the agent
# We deliberately never exit 1: a non-2 nonzero would let the tool run anyway
# (fail-open). Every path below ends in an explicit `allow` or `block`.
#
# This guard is a per-tool accelerator (best UX: it blocks the write before it
# happens) over the same invariant the git-level hooks enforce. It governs AI
# actions taken through Claude Code's tools only; the invocation-agnostic
# backstop that also covers a human's direct git usage is the git-level
# pre-commit/pre-push hooks (.githooks/ → bin/guard-protected-branch), activated
# by bin/install-git-hooks. Layer 3 must never be the ONLY guard (ADR 0009).

# The protected-branch list is NOT hardcoded: it is read from the sidecar
# .githooks/protected-branches (generated from PROJECT.md — the single authored
# source — by bin/install-git-hooks). Resolve it relative to this script:
# .claude/hooks/../../.githooks. If the sidecar is missing/empty, fail CLOSED to
# a safe default set (never fail open).

# Bash tool: the only thing we care about is a git operation that could land a
# commit / move a ref onto a protected branch. We parse the command so the guard
# can't be sidestepped with the forms the old prefix matcher ("Bash(git
# commit:*)") silently missed:
#   - `git -C <dir> commit`                 (run against another checkout)
#   - `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=x git commit`        (leading ENV=val assignments)
#   - `cd <dir> && git commit`              (directory change first)
#   - `(cd <dir> && git commit)` / `$(...)` (subshell / command substitution)
#   - `git push origin main` / `HEAD:main`  (protected refspec from any branch)
# Anything that is not such an operation is allowed (read-only git, file writes,
# etc.) — per the rule that this guard's sole concern is commits/pushes to a
# protected branch.
#
# To avoid FALSE blocks, string-literal content is treated as data, not commands:
# heredoc bodies are cut (above) and quotes/backticks are NOT unwrapped, so a
# commit message or echo that merely mentions `git push origin main` is ignored.
#
# RESIDUAL (documented, not covered here): a string parser cannot defeat a
# Turing-complete shell, and it cannot perfectly tell code from a quoted literal.
#   - Under-block: `bash -c '<quoted compound>'`, `eval`, base64-decoded
#     commands, or a repo path built at runtime can still reach a commit.
#   - Over-block: a one-line inline message that literally contains a command
#     separator AND git text — `git commit -m "did x && git push origin main"` —
#     could still trip the scan (use a heredoc / `-F` for such messages).
# The complete, invocation-agnostic backstop is the git-level pre-commit /
# pre-push hooks (git runs them no matter how the commit was triggered, with zero
# string parsing). See .githooks/ and bin/guard-protected-branch.
