# Tests for enforce-branch-creation.sh (Layer 3 fast-fail guard, ADR 0009).
#
# Run:  .claude/hooks/enforce-branch-creation.test.sh
# Exit: 0 if every case passes, 1 otherwise.
#
# These build throwaway git repos in a temp dir and feed the hook real
# PreToolUse-shaped JSON payloads on stdin, asserting the exit code
# (0 = allow, 2 = block). No network, no touching the real repo. The protected
# list comes from the repo's own .githooks/protected-branches sidecar (the hook
# resolves it relative to its own location), which is main/master/develop.
#
# Coverage map (what each block proves):
#   - Worktree-awareness: a write/commit in a feature-branch checkout is allowed
#     even though a *different* checkout is on main (the original misfire).
#   - Commit-to-main is blocked through every realistic Bash form: plain,
#     `git -C <dir>`, `cd <dir> && git`, and leading `ENV=val` assignments.
#   - Read-only Bash on main is allowed (the guard's scope is commits/pushes).
#   - Out-of-repo writes (the /tmp scratchpad) are allowed.
#   - Pushes targeting a protected ref are blocked even from a feature branch.
#
# This guard is the per-tool accelerator; the invocation-agnostic backstop for
# ALL commit paths (human, IDE, `--no-verify`) is the git-level pre-commit /
# pre-push hooks in .githooks/ (bin/guard-protected-branch), covered by the
# bundle repo's test/guard_protected_branch.test.sh (the test/ tree is not
# vendored into Host Apps, so in a vendored copy that suite runs upstream).
