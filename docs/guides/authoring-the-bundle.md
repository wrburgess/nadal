# Authoring the Config Bundle

Conventions for **developing this repo** (adding skills, adapters, rules, and parity checks) — distinct
from the host-facing [`rules/`](../../rules) Lean Core, which is guidance for a Host App's own agents.
These are lessons captured as they were learned; extend as the bundle grows.

## Parity checks: gate on the tree, assert a floor, then check every present member

New structural checks in [`scripts/parity_check.rb`](../../scripts/parity_check.rb) follow one shape,
established by `check_rules`, `check_guardrails`, and `check_skills`:

1. **Gate on the surface existing.** `return unless Dir.exist?(path(SURFACE_DIR))` (or the presence of a
   signalling file, e.g. the guardrail sidecar). A bundle that does not ship the surface must **no-op**,
   so minimal / partial fixtures and downstream bundles are never reddened by a check for something they
   deliberately omit.
2. **Assert a `REQUIRED_*` floor.** A small hardcoded list (e.g. `REQUIRED_RULES`, `REQUIRED_SKILLS`)
   proves the expected members ship. This is the **only** part that grows per issue — usually one line.
3. **Apply the structural (shape) checks to every _present_ member**, discovered from disk — not to a
   hardcoded per-member list. Because the shape is enforced on whatever is present, members a later issue
   adds are **covered by construction**, with no edit to the check.

Keep the checker **stdlib-only** (no gems, no bundler — [ADR 0008](../adr/0008-structural-parity-check-not-model-in-the-loop.md)),
assert **section/heading presence, not content**, so a host freely extends a file's body without
reddening CI, and keep all `puts`/`warn` output **ASCII** (`rules/scripting.md`). Every new check needs a
matching self-test in `test/parity_check_test.rb`: one happy path plus
one case per failure mode, each asserting **both** the non-zero exit **and** the specific error string, so
the check can never become a silent false green.

### Content checks: match forbidden tokens on word boundaries, not raw substrings

A check that scans a file's *content* for forbidden tokens — as the skills content-neutrality check
does (every lifecycle body must reference `PROJECT.md`, and no host-specific proper noun may appear in
any body) — must **not** use a naive `String#include?`. A pure-alphabetic token like `rspec` is a
substring of the innocent word `underspecified`, so raw-substring matching is a false positive waiting
to happen. Split the matcher by token shape:

- **Pure-alphabetic tokens** (`Searchkick`, `rspec`) match only on ASCII-letter word boundaries —
  `/(?<![A-Za-z])TOKEN(?![A-Za-z])/` — so the token matches as a standalone word but not inside a
  larger one.
- **Tokens carrying punctuation** (`bundler-audit`, `.claude/rules/`, `admin_root_path`) match as plain
  substrings; no benign word contains them, and a boundary rule would misfire on the trailing `/`.

Test **both** branches — a positive case per branch **and** a case proving the innocent superword
(`underspecified`) stays green, so the boundary rule itself can't silently regress.

### Structured files: validate with the language's parser, never a regex over the raw text

A check that asserts the **shape of a structured file** — YAML frontmatter, JSON, TOML — must hand the
text to the language's parser. Assert on the parsed object, not on the source.

`check_skills` originally proved a Skill's frontmatter carried a `name:` key with `/\Aname:\s*\S/`
inside the `---` fence. That regex matches happily on frontmatter that **no YAML parser can read**: an
unquoted `": "` inside a prose `description:` — the single most likely authoring mistake, since
descriptions are prose and prose contains colons — passed the gate and shipped a Skill that was
silently undiscoverable in every consuming tool. A regex proves the text *looks* parseable; every
consumer needs it to *be* parseable, and the whole defect lives in that gap
(issue [#103](https://github.com/wrburgess/ace/issues/103)).

Three things the parse-based version had to get right, each of which is easy to get wrong:

- **Distinguish _absent_ from _malformed_ in the state enum.** The helper returns `:none` (no fence at
  all) and `:unterminated` (an opening `---` never closed) as **separate** states, because one caller —
  the Claude Invocation Shim — is deliberately allowed to have no frontmatter. Collapse the two and
  that "absent is allowed" rule silently becomes "**broken** is allowed", which is exactly the false
  green a Reviewer caught in this check's own plan. Whenever one state is permitted, make sure the
  enum permits *only* what it names.
- **Report file-absolute line numbers.** A parser numbers lines within the string it is handed, so
  parsing the fence-stripped block reports `line 2` for what is file line 3. An error that sends the
  author to the wrong line is worse than no line number. Pad the block with one blank line per stripped
  line (blank lines are valid YAML) so the counter agrees with the file, and pass the real path via
  `filename:` so the message is not prefixed `(<unknown>)`.
- **A non-mapping root parses cleanly.** `---\n- one\n- two\n---` yields an `Array` and `---\n---`
  yields `nil`, neither raising. The explicit `is_a?(Hash)` assertion is load-bearing, not
  belt-and-braces — and the caller's message must read correctly for the `nil` case rather than
  emitting "parsed as NilClass".

Choose the parser's strictness **deliberately** rather than inheriting a default: `YAML.safe_load`'s
default `permitted_classes` and `aliases: false` are passed explicitly here, so a future key needing a
`Date` becomes a reviewed widening instead of a silent one.

## Porting a template of record: copy byte-identical, verify with `diff -q`

When porting an artifact that is **already business- and tool-neutral** (e.g. a skill body from the
template-of-record repo), copy it **verbatim** and prove it:

```
diff -q <source>/SKILL.md skills/<name>/SKILL.md   # must report nothing
```

Do **not** "improve," reformat, or re-word it in transit. A verbatim port is trivially reviewable (the
diff is provably the source), avoids silent drift from the template of record, and keeps the reason the
artifact was chosen — that it needed no de-coupling — actually true. If a source file *does* carry
host/domain coupling, that de-coupling is real work: call it out in the assessment and plan, and do it as
a visible, reviewed edit — never fold it silently into a "port."

**Worked example — a non-byte-neutral port.** The six lifecycle skills (`assess` … `final`, issue #9)
were the opposite of `distill`: their source bodies carried heavy host/domain coupling —
hardcoded quality-check commands, `Searchkick`/`Pundit`, model names, `admin_root_path`, `P0`/`P1`
severities. The de-coupling was done as visible, reviewed edits (each value re-routed to `PROJECT.md`)
and, crucially, made **enforceable** rather than merely reviewed: the content-neutrality check above
reddens CI if any lifecycle body reintroduces a host token or stops referencing `PROJECT.md`. The
lesson: when a port is **not** byte-neutral, pair the reviewed de-coupling with a parity check that
keeps it de-coupled for the next author — a `diff -q` proves a verbatim port, and a content check
proves a de-coupled one stays de-coupled.
