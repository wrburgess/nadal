# deliver — Stage 5 of the lifecycle

The packaged procedure for
[Chapter 1 → Stage 5 — Deliver](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stage-5--deliver). This body
carries the verbs and links the variables; the stage itself — trigger, work, terminal artifact,
exit — is canon and is not restated here.

## When it is invoked

The Verification on the pull request carries no open must-fix finding —
[the Stage 5 trigger](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stage-5--deliver).

## Procedure

1. **Read the pull request from the tracker** — description, labels, the current head, the whole
   diff, the Verification, and every comment and thread
   ([Stage 5](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stage-5--deliver)).
2. **Read the issue the pull request links** — title, body, labels, and every existing comment;
   the Assessment, the gate record, and the latest posted Plan are among the comments, and the
   record is written from them
   ([Chapter 1 → Stages communicate only through terminal artifacts](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stages-communicate-only-through-terminal-artifacts)).
3. **Read the stage's routing** — which model and effort runs this stage is
   [`config/models.md`](../../config/models.md); what may be offloaded, and in what shape, is
   [`config/delegation.md`](../../config/delegation.md).
4. **Re-confirm the checks are green on the current head** — green is confirmed here, never
   produced here; a red check re-enters [Verify](../verify/SKILL.md), where the fix loop lives,
   and this stage runs again from its trigger
   ([Stage 5](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stage-5--deliver);
   [ADR 0009](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/adr/0009-review-response-folded-into-verify.md)).
5. **Read [`rules/authoring.md`](../../rules/authoring.md)** at the moment of writing.
6. **Write the three prose fields first** — why the other options were rejected; what was tried
   and abandoned, so it is not re-proposed; what is fragile, and what the AC was unsure about at
   the end — each carrying only what the repository cannot reconstruct
   ([Chapter 1 → The Delivery Record](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#the-delivery-record)).
7. **Assemble the Record in its declared shape** — Summary (HC) with Problem then Solution;
   Changes grouped by the architectural map the HC reads the repository through, empty groups
   omitted; Findings with the four health measures; Description (AC + HC) carrying the prose
   fields and the limitations — content and shape per
   [The Delivery Record](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#the-delivery-record), the four
   health measures per
   [Chapter 1 → Where the health measures live](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#where-the-health-measures-live),
   the scannable half's rules per [Chapter 1 → The Readout](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#the-readout).
8. **Post the Delivery Record on the pull request and set `status:done-pending-merge` on
   posting**
   ([Stage 5](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stage-5--deliver);
   [Chapter 1 → Binding to the Work Tracking System](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#binding-to-the-work-tracking-system)).
9. **Post the reference on the issue** — a link to the Record — then **act on the Ship gate per its
   current setting** ([`config/gates.md`](../../config/gates.md)). The setting is read there, never
   from this file; the floor no setting reaches is canon
   ([Chapter 0 → Governance](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/00-identity-and-governance.md#governance) → *Merge
   authority*; [Stage 5](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stage-5--deliver)).

## Terminal artifact

The Delivery Record on the pull request, plus the reference on the issue
([Stage 5](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stage-5--deliver)).

## When it stops and asks

On any of the four standing triggers —
[Chapter 1 → Stops](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/sds/01-lifecycle-and-skills.md#stops). The question and its answer are
recorded on the pull request before the answer is acted on.

## Prior art

Re-authored from a reading of
[ace's `final`](https://github.com/wrburgess/ace/blob/main/skills/final/SKILL.md), per
[ADR 0006](https://github.com/wrburgess/deuce/blob/main/adr/0006-skills-self-contained.md) — read and attributed, never vendored.
